(aag), a delaware corporation, is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries are american airlines, inc. (american), envoy aviation group inc. (envoy), psa airlines, inc. (psa) and piedmont airlines, inc. (piedmont). aag was formed in 1982 under the name amr corporation (amr) as the parent company of american, which was founded in 1934. aag s and american s principal executive offices are located at 4333 amon carter boulevard, fort worth, texas 76155 and their telephone number is 817-963-1234. airline operations our primary business activity is the operation of a major network carrier, providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo. together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as american eagle, our airline operates an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries through hubs and gateways in charlotte, chicago, dallas/fort worth, london heathrow, los angeles, miami, new york, philadelphia, phoenix and washington, d.c. in 2018 , approximately 204 million passengers boarded our flights. during 2018 , we launched new seasonal nonstop service to budapest, hungary and prague, czech republic from philadelphia international airport (phl), to venice, italy from chicago o hare international airport (ord) and to reykjavik-keflavik, iceland from dallas/fort worth international airport (dfw), further expanding our global footprint. we also announced new seasonal nonstop service beginning in summer 2019 between phl and dubrovnik, croatia, berlin, germany and bologna, italy. as of december 31, 2018 , we operated 956 mainline aircraft supported by our regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers, which operated an additional 595 regional aircraft. see part i, item 2. properties for further discussion on our mainline and regional aircraft and regional below for further discussion on our regional operations. american is a founding member of the one world alliance, whose members serve more than 1,000 destinations with approximately 14,250 daily flights to over 150 countries. see below for further discussion on the one world alliance and other agreements with domestic and international airlines. see part ii, item 7. management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 2018 financial overview , aag s results of operations and american s results of operations for further discussion of aag s and american s operating results and operating performance. also, see note 14 to aag s consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8a and note 12 to american s consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8b for information regarding operating segments and see note 1(k) to aag s and american s consolidated financial statements in part ii, items 8a and 8b, respectively, for passenger revenue by geographic region. regional our regional carriers provide scheduled air transportation under the brand name american eagle. the american eagle carriers include our wholly-owned regional carriers envoy, psa and piedmont, as well as third-party regional carriers including republic airline inc. (republic), mesa airlines, inc. (mesa), compass airlines, llc (compass) and skywest airlines, inc. (skywest). in addition, air wisconsin corporation (air wisconsin), trans states airlines, inc. (trans states) and expressjet airlines, inc. (expressjet) operated regional jet aircraft for us during 2018; however these arrangements ended in february 2018, december 2018 and january 2019, respectively. our regional carriers are an integral component of our operating network. we rely heavily on feeder traffic to our hubs from low-density markets that are not economical for us to serve with larger, mainline aircraft. in addition, regional carriers offer complementary service in our existing mainline markets. during 2018 , approximately 56 million passengers boarded our regional carriers planes, approximately 44% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights. of these passengers, approximately 31 million were enplaned by our wholly-owned regional carriers and approximately 25 million were enplaned by third-party regional carriers. all american eagle carriers use logos, service marks, aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to our mainline operations. substantially all of our regional carrier arrangements are in the form of capacity purchase agreements. the capacity purchase agreements provide that all revenues, including passenger, in-flight, ancillary, mail and freight revenues, go to us. we control marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. in return, we agree to pay predetermined fees to 5 these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board. in addition, these agreements provide that we either reimburse or pay 100% of certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees, fuel and passenger liability insurance. cargo our cargo division provides a wide range of freight and mail services, with facilities and interline connections available across the globe. distribution and marketing agreements passengers can purchase tickets for travel on american through several distribution channels, including our website ( www.aa.com ), our reservations centers and third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (e.g., amadeus, sabre and travelport), conventional travel agents, travel management companies and online travel agents (e.g., expedia , including its booking sites orbitz and travelocity, and the priceline group). to remain competitive, we need to successfully manage our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. for more discussion, see part i, item 1a. risk factors we rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels . in general, beyond nonstop city pairs, carriers that have the greatest ability to seamlessly connect passengers to and from markets have a competitive advantage. in some cases, however, foreign governments limit u.s. air carriers rights to transport passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign countries. in order to improve access to domestic and foreign markets, we have arrangements with other airlines including through the one world alliance, other cooperation agreements, joint business agreements (jbas), and marketing relationships, as further discussed below. member of oneworld alliance american is a founding member of the one world alliance, which includes british airways, cathay pacific airways, finnair, iberia, japan airlines, latam airlines group, malaysia airlines, qantas airways, qatar airways, royal jordanian, s7 airlines and srilankan airlines. the one world alliance links the networks of the member carriers and their respective affiliates to enhance customer service and smooth connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking the carriers loyalty programs and access to the carriers airport lounge facilities. cooperation and joint business agreements american has established a transatlantic jba with british airways, iberia and finnair, and separately, a transpacific jba with japan airlines, each of which has been granted antitrust immunity. joint business agreements enable the carriers party to the relevant agreement to cooperate on flights between particular destinations and allow pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs, enhanced loyalty program reciprocity and cooperation in other areas. accordingly, american and its joint business partners received regulatory approval to enter into these jbas and cooperation agreements. joint business agreements have become common approaches to address key regulatory restrictions typically applicable to international airline service, including limitations on the foreign ownership of airlines and national laws prohibiting foreign airlines from carrying passengers beyond specific gateway cities. our competitors, including delta air lines and united airlines, are party to similar arrangements. in october 2017, american and its transatlantic partners executed an amended and restated jba which, among other things, extends the term of the agreement. an application is pending with the u.s. department of transportation (dot) to add aer lingus, which is now owned by the parent company of british airways and iberia, to the transatlantic jba. the transatlantic joint business relationship benefits from a grant of antitrust immunity from the dot and was reviewed by the european commission (ec) in july 2010. in connection with this review, we provided certain commitments to the ec regarding, among other things, the availability of take-off and landing slots at london heathrow (lhr) or london gatwick (lgw) airports. the commitments accepted by the ec are binding for 10 years with the possibility of renewal by the ec. however, in light of the impending exit of the united kingdom from the european union (eu) (brexit) and the related possibility that the ec would no longer have regulatory responsibility for the united kingdom when the commitments expire in july 2020, the united kingdom competition and markets authority (cma) in october 2018 opened an investigation into the transatlantic jba. we are cooperating fully with the cma. we have also signed a jba with qantas airways and in 2015 applied for antitrust immunity with the dot for the revised relationship, but we withdrew that application in november 2016 after it was tentatively denied by the dot. in february 2018, we filed a new application for antitrust immunity with the dot, which, if granted, would allow us to further expand our 6 relationship with qantas airways. this jba has been approved by the competition law regulators in australia and new zealand. in addition, we have signed jbas with certain air carriers of the latam airlines group, which jbas have been approved in all jurisdictions other than the united states, where approval is pending. most recently, in november 2018, the court of free competition in chile approved the jba between american and latam airlines group with respect to both our passenger and cargo businesses. that decision has been appealed to the chilean supreme court. in november 2018, we announced that we are taking steps to strengthen our partnership with china southern airlines company limited (china southern airlines), in which we presently hold a 2.2% equity interest, with a significant expansion of codeshare cooperation and the launch of reciprocal loyalty program benefits and lounge access. marketing relationships to improve access to each other s markets, various u.s. and foreign air carriers, including american, have established marketing agreements with other airlines. these marketing agreements generally provide enhanced customer choice by means of an expanded network with reciprocal loyalty program participation and joint sales cooperation. american currently has codeshare and/or loyalty program relationships with air tahiti nui, alaska airlines, british airways, cape air, cathay dragon, cathay pacific, china southern airlines, el al, etihad airways, fiji airways, finnair, gulf air, hawaiian airlines, iberia, interjet, japan airlines, jetstar group (includes jetstar airways and jetstar japan), korean air, latam (includes latam airlines, latam argentina, latam brasil, latam peru, latam colombia and latam ecuador), malaysia airlines, qantas airways, qatar airways, royal jordanian, s7 airlines, seaborne airlines and srilankan airlines. loyalty program our loyalty program, aadvantage , was established to develop passenger loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued patronage. aadvantage was named best elite program in the americas for the seventh consecutive year in that category at the 2018 freddie awards, which are annual awards that recognize the world s most outstanding frequent travel programs. aadvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on american, any one world airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of over 1,000 program participants, such as the citi and barclaycard us co-branded credit cards, hotels and car rental companies. for every dollar spent, non-status members earn five mileage credits, but gold, platinum, platinum pro and executive platinum status holders earn bonus mileage credits of seven, eight, nine and eleven mileage credits, respectively. all travel on eligible tickets counts toward qualification for elite status in the aadvantage program. mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded travel on american and participating airlines, membership to our admirals club or for other non-travel awards from our program participants. most travel awards are subject to capacity-controlled seating. a member s mileage credit does not expire as long as that member has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 18 months. elite members can enjoy additional benefits of the aadvantage program, including complimentary upgrades, checked bags, and preferred and main cabin extra seats, as well as priority check-in, security, boarding and baggage delivery. additionally, our members earn bonus mileage credits when elite status is obtained. under our agreements with aadvantage members and program partners, we reserve the right to change the aadvantage program at any time without notice, and may end the program with six months notice. program rules, partners, special offers, awards and requisite mileage levels for awards are subject to change. during 2018 , our members redeemed approximately 13 million awards including travel redemptions for flights and upgrades on american and other air carriers, as well as redemption of car and hotel awards, club memberships and merchandise. approximately 7.6% of our 2018 total revenue passenger miles flown were from award travel. see part ii, item 7. management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimate s for more information on our loyalty program. industry competition domestic the markets in which we operate are highly competitive. on most of our domestic nonstop routes, we currently face competing service from other domestic airlines, including major network airlines, low-cost carriers and ultra-low-cost carriers such as alaska airlines, allegiant air, delta air lines, frontier airlines, hawaiian airlines, jetblue airways, southwest airlines, spirit airlines and united airlines. competition is even greater between cities that require a connection, where the major airlines compete via their respective hubs. in addition, we face competition on some of our connecting routes from airlines 7 operating point-to-point service on such routes. we also compete with all-cargo and charter airlines and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation. on all of our routes, pricing decisions are affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from other airlines. price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, targeted promotions and loyalty program initiatives. airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slack travel periods, when they begin service to new cities or when they have excess capacity, to generate cash flow, to maximize revenue per available seat mile and to establish, increase or preserve market share. we have often elected to match discount or promotional fares initiated by other air carriers in certain markets in order to compete in those markets. most airlines will quickly match price reductions in a particular market. in addition, low-fare, low-cost carriers, such as southwest airlines and jetblue airways, and so-called ultra-low-cost carriers, such as allegiant air, frontier airlines and spirit airlines, compete in many of the markets in which we operate and competition from these carriers is increasing. in addition to price competition, airlines compete for market share by increasing the size of their route system and the number of markets they serve. the american eagle regional carriers increase the number of markets we serve by flying to lower demand markets and providing connections at our hubs. many of our competitors also own or have agreements with regional airlines that provide similar services at their hubs and other locations. we also compete on the basis of scheduling (frequency and flight times), availability of nonstop flights, on-time performance, type of equipment, cabin configuration, amenities provided to passengers, loyalty programs, the automation of travel agent reservation systems, onboard products, markets served and other services. international in addition to our extensive domestic service, we provide international service to canada, central and south america, asia, europe, australia and new zealand. in providing international air transportation, we compete with u.s. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines. competition is increasing from foreign state-owned and state-affiliated airlines in the gulf region, including emirates, etihad airways and qatar airways . these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft in service and on order and are increasing service to the u.s. from locations both in and outside the middle east. service to and from locations outside of the middle east is provided by some of these carriers under so-called fifth freedom rights permitted under international treaties which allow service to and from stopover points between an airline s home country and the ultimate destination. such flights, such as a stopover in europe on flights to the united states, allow the carrier to sell tickets for travel between the stopover point and the united states in competition with service provided by us. additionally, these carriers have made significant investments in a number of airlines located outside of the middle east, such as air italy, providing these affiliated airlines with capital and aircraft to permit increases in service that compete with us. we believe these state-owned and state-affiliated carriers in the gulf region, including their affiliated carriers, benefit from significant government subsidies, which have allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence. competition is also increasing from low-cost airlines executing international long-haul expansion strategies, including, for example, icelandair, norwegian air shuttle and wow air. in order to increase our ability to compete for international air transportation service, which is subject to extensive government regulation, u.s. and foreign carriers have entered into bilateral and multilateral marketing relationships, alliances, cooperation agreements and jbas to exchange traffic among each other s flights and route networks. see distribution and marketing agreements above for further discussion. employees and labor relations the airline business is labor intensive. in 2018 , salaries, wages and benefits were our largest expense and represented approximately 33% of our total operating expenses. as of december 31, 2018 , we had approximately 128,900 active full-time equivalent employees, approximately 84% of whom were represented by various labor unions responsible for negotiating the collective bargaining agreements (cbas) covering them. labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act (rla), which vests in the national mediation board (nmb) certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and cbas. when an rla cba becomes amendable, if either party to the agreement wishes to modify its terms, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed under the rla and as agreed by the parties. under the rla, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and, if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator. the rla prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. if no agreement is reached in mediation, the nmb in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration to the parties. either party may decline to submit to arbitration, and if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day cooling 8 off period commences. during or after that period, a presidential emergency board (peb) may be established, which examines the parties positions and recommends a solution. the peb process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day cooling off period. at the end of this cooling off period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by congress, the labor organization may exercise self-help, such as a strike, and the airline may resort to its own self-help, including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments to the cba and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers. none of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully engage in concerted slowdowns or refusals to work, such as strikes, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. nonetheless, there is a risk that disgruntled employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance. the following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions: union class or craft employees (1) contract amendable date mainline: allied pilots association (apa) pilots 13,600 2020 association of professional flight attendants (apfa) flight attendants 24,800 2019 airline customer service employee association communications

equivalent employees as of december 31, 2018 . joint collective bargaining agreements (jcbas) have been reached with post-merger employee groups, except for contracts with the twu-iam association which represents the maintenance, fleet service, stock clerks, maintenance control technicians and maintenance training instructors whose contracts became amendable in the third quarter of 2018. negotiations designed to reach jcbas involving all of these workgroups continue. additionally, the post-merger jcbas covering our pilots and flight attendants, while not yet amendable, provide the unions with the right to elect to commence negotiations for new collective bargaining agreements in advance of each jcba s amendable date. both of the unions have exercised these rights and negotiations are underway for new agreements. among our wholly-owned regional subsidiaries, the psa flight attendants have an agreement that is now amendable and are engaged in traditional rla negotiations. in january 2019, the envoy passenger service employees reached a tentative seven-year labor agreement subject to membership ratification. for more discussion, see part i, item 1a. risk factors union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels may adversely affect our operations and financial performance . aircraft fuel our operations and financial results are significantly affected by the availability and price of jet fuel, which is our second largest expense. based on our 2019 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption, we estimate that a one cent per gallon increase in aviation fuel price would increase our 2019 annual fuel expense by $45 million . the following table shows annual aircraft fuel consumption and costs, including taxes, for our mainline and regional operations for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 (gallons and aircraft fuel expense in millions). year gallons average price per gallon aircraft fuel expense percent of total operating expenses 2018 4,447 $2.23 $9,896 23.6% 2017 4,352 1.73 7,510 19.6% 2016 4,347 1.42 6,180 17.6% as of december 31, 2018 , we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. as such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully 10 exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. fuel prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years. we cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. natural disasters (including hurricanes or similar events in the u.s. southeast and on the gulf coast where a significant portion of domestic refining capacity is located), political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, economic sanctions imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in the cost to transport or store petroleum products, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, distribution challenges, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. see part i, item 1a. risk factors our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity . seasonality and other factors due to the greater demand for air travel during the summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year tend to be greater than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year. general economic conditions, fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. therefore, our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. domestic and global regulatory landscape general airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. domestically, the dot and the federal aviation administration (faa) exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers. the dot, among other things, oversees domestic and international codeshare agreements, international route authorities, competition and consumer protection matters such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability. the antitrust division of the department of justice (doj), along with the dot in certain instances, have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. the faa similarly exercises safety oversight and regulates most operational matters of our business, including how we operate and maintain our aircraft. faa requirements cover, among other things, required technology and necessary onboard equipment; systems, procedures and training necessary to ensure the continuous airworthiness of our fleet of aircraft; safety measures and equipment; crew scheduling limitations and experience requirements; and many other technical aspects of airline operations. additionally, our pilots and other employees are subject to rigorous certification standards, and our pilots and other crew members must adhere to flight time and rest requirements. the faa also controls the national airspace system, including operational rules and fees for air traffic control (atc) services. the efficiency, reliability and capacity of the atc network has a significant impact on our costs and on the timeliness of our operations. the u.s. postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services. airport access and operations domestically, any u.s. airline authorized by the dot is generally free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the u.s. and its territories, with the exception of certain airports that require landing and take-off rights and authorizations (slots) and other facilities, and certain airports that impose geographic limitations on operations or curtail operations based on the time of day. operations at three major domestic airports we serve (john f. kennedy international airport (jfk) and la guardia airport (lga) in new york city, and ronald reagan washington national airport (dca) in washington, d.c.) and many foreign airports we serve (including lhr) are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms that limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period. in addition to slot restrictions, operations at lga and dca are also limited based on a so-called perimeter rule which generally limits the stage length of the flights that can be operated from those airports to 1,500 and 1,250 miles, respectively. 11 our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as ord in chicago and los angeles international airport (lax), where the airport gate and other facilities are currently inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide. existing law also permits domestic local airport authorities to implement procedures and impose restrictions designed to abate noise, provided such procedures and restrictions do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system. in some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs. airline fares, taxes and user fees airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation. the dot maintains authority over certain international fares, rates and charges, but applies this authority on a limited basis. in addition, international fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which we serve. airlines are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the ticket tax, on domestic and international air transportation, and to collect other taxes and charge other fees, such as foreign taxes, security fees and passenger facility charges. although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. these taxes and fees are subject to increase from time to time. dot passenger protection rules the dot regulates airline interactions with passengers through the ticketing process, at the airport and on board the aircraft. among other things, these regulations govern how our fares are displayed online, required customer disclosures, access by disabled passengers, handling of long onboard flight delays and reporting of mishandled bags. in addition, the dot is likely to issue a regulation in 2019 that would require air carriers to refund checked bag fees in the event of certain delays in delivery. international international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation, including aviation agreements between the u.s. and other countries or governmental authorities, such as the eu. moreover, alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. the u.s. government has negotiated open skies agreements with over 120 countries, which allow unrestricted route authority access between the u.s. and the foreign markets. while the u.s. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of markets important to us, including china, do not have open skies agreements. in addition, foreign countries impose passenger protection rules, which are analogous to, and often meet or exceed the requirements of, the dot passenger protection rules discussed above. in cases where these foreign requirements exceed the dot rules, we may bear additional burdens and liabilities. further, various foreign airport authorities impose noise restrictions at their local airports. security since shortly after the events of september 11, 2001, substantially all aspects of civil aviation security in the u.s. or affecting u.s. carriers have been controlled or regulated by the federal government through the transportation security administration (tsa). requirements include flight deck security; carriage of federal air marshals at no charge; enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors; fingerprint-based background checks of all employees and vendor employees with access to secure areas of airports; and the provision of certain passenger data to the federal government and other international border security authorities, for security and immigration controls. funding for the tsa is provided by a combination of air carrier fees, passenger fees and taxpayer funds. customs and border protection, which, like the tsa, is part of the department of homeland security (dhs), also promulgates requirements, performs services and collects fees that impact our provision of services. additionally, we have at times found it necessary or desirable to make significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while seeking to reduce their impact on our customers, such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. our international service further requires us to comply with the civil aviation security regimes imposed at the foreign airports we serve. 12 environmental matters environmental regulation the airline industry is subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters in the u.s. and other countries. u.s. federal laws that have a particular impact on our operations include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990, the clean air act, the resource conservation and recovery act, the clean water act, the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (superfund act). the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations. in addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. many state and local governments have adopted environmental laws and regulations which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements. revised underground storage tank regulations issued by the epa in 2015 have affected certain airport fuel hydrant systems, with modifications of such systems needed in order to comply with applicable portions of the revised regulations. in addition, related to the epa and state regulations pertaining to stormwater management, several u.s. airport authorities are actively engaged in efforts to limit discharges of deicing fluid into the environment, often by requiring airlines to participate in the building or reconfiguring of airport deicing facilities. the environmental laws to which we are subject include those related to responsibility for potential soil and groundwater contamination. we are conducting investigation and remediation activities to address soil and groundwater conditions at several sites, including airports and maintenance bases. we presently anticipate that the ongoing costs of such activities will not have a material impact on our operations. in addition, we have been named as a potentially responsible party (prp) at certain superfund sites. our alleged volumetric contributions at such sites are relatively small in comparison to total contributions of all prps. accordingly, we presently anticipate that any future payments of costs at such sites will not have a material impact on our operations. aircraft emissions and climate change requirements many aspects of our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations and concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. for example, the eu has established the emissions trading system (ets) to regulate ghg emissions in the eu. the eu adopted a directive in 2008 under which each eu member state is required to extend the ets to aviation operations. however, the eu ets has never fully been imposed, in large part due to the global effort to moderate international aviation emissions solely through the international civil aviation organization (icao). the eu has extended its stay on the extra-territorial application of the eu ets as applied to international flights to/from the european economic area (eea) through year-end 2023, contingent on successful implementation of corsia. thereafter, the eu will assess corsia implementation and decide the future status of the eu ets as applied to international aviation to/from the eea. the u.s. enacted legislation in november 2012 intended to encourage an international solution through icao, but which also authorizes the u.s. secretary of transportation to prohibit u.s. airlines from participating in the ets. in 2016, icao passed a resolution adopting the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation (corsia), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program intended to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. corsia applies to international aviation, and does not directly impact domestic u.s. flights. corsia was supported by the board of airlines for america (the principal u.s. airline trade association, of which we are a member), the international air transport association (iata) (the principal international airline trade association), and by american and many other u.s. and foreign airlines. in march 2017, icao also adopted new aircraft certification standards to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft, which will apply to new aircraft type designs commencing in 2020, and to aircraft type designs already in production as of 2023. on june 27, 2018, icao adopted standards pertaining to the collection and sharing of information on international aviation emissions beginning in 2019. airline operators must prepare ghg monitoring plans by february 2019. corsia will increase operating costs for american and most other airlines, including other u.s. airlines that operate internationally, but the implementation of a global program, as compared to regional emission reduction schemes, should ensure that resulting increases in operating costs will be more evenly applied to american and its competitors since there will be a common global regulatory regime. corsia is expected to be implemented in phases, with information collection and sharing beginning in 2019, a pilot phase beginning in 2021, and the first phase beginning in 2024. certain details still need to be developed and the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted. in 2019, the epa could finalize a rule implementing aircraft engine ghg emission standards developed initially through icao. it is anticipated that the epa rule will closely align with recent icao carbon dioxide emission standards. the new standards, which were supported by the airline industry and manufacturers, would apply to new type aircraft certified beginning in 2020, and would be phased in for newly manufactured existing aircraft type designs starting in 2023. 13 in addition, several states have adopted or are considering initiatives to regulate ghg emissions, primarily through the planned development of ghg emissions inventories, regional ghg cap and trade programs or low carbon fuel programs. we have taken a number of actions that mitigate our ghg emissions and conserve fuel such as: retiring older aircraft and replacing them with new, more fuel-efficient aircraft; reducing fuel consumption through our fuel smart program, which is an employee-led effort to safely reduce fuel consumption at american; a similar program is underway to reduce fuel consumption at our regional carriers; working with the faa and vendors to facilitate efficient airspace procedures, which also reduces aircraft emissions; replacing existing cargo containers with lightweight versions; replacing older, inefficient ground support equipment with new, more fuel-efficient ground support equipment, including alternative-fuel and electric powered equipment; purchasing renewable energy to reduce indirect emissions; seeking certification of certain of our buildings to the u.s. green building council s leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) standard; entering into discussions with potential vendors to further explore potential production pathways for sustainable alternative jet fuel; and cooperating with airports and other stakeholders to accelerate the introduction of sustainable alternative fuels for further information,

business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities. we caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. we operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business. downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business . due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the u.s. economy and economies in other regions of the world. unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our business. see also the airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic below. our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity . our operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. market prices for jet fuel have fluctuated substantially over the past several years and prices continue to be highly volatile. because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of fuel can have a material effect on our operating results and liquidity. due to the competitive nature of the airline industry and unpredictability of the market for air travel, we can offer no assurance that we may be able to increase our fares, impose fuel surcharges or otherwise increase revenues or decrease other operating costs sufficiently to offset fuel price increases. similarly, we cannot predict actions that may be taken by our competitors in response to changes in fuel prices. although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, we cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. natural disasters (including hurricanes or similar events in the u.s. southeast and on the gulf coast where a significant portion of domestic refining capacity is located), political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, economic sanctions imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in the cost to transport or store petroleum products, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, distribution challenges, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. any of these factors or events could cause a disruption in oil production, refinery operations, pipeline capacity or terminal access and possibly result in significant increases in the price of aircraft fuel and diminished availability of aircraft fuel supply. our aviation fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide meaningful price protection against increases in fuel costs. our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review this policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. accordingly, as of december 31, 2018 , we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding. as such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. see also the discussion in part ii, item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aircraft fuel. the airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic. our competitors include other major domestic airlines and foreign, regional and new entrant airlines, as well as joint ventures formed by some of these airlines, many of which have more financial or other resources and/or lower cost structures than ours, as well as other forms of transportation, including rail and private automobiles. in many of our markets we compete with at least one low-cost carrier (including so-called ultra-low cost carriers). our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity, amenities, loyalty benefits and promotions, which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues, but on overall industry revenues. these factors may become even more significant in periods when the industry experiences large losses, as airlines under financial stress, or in bankruptcy, may institute pricing structures intended to achieve near-term survival rather than long-term viability. 16 low-cost carriers (including so-called ultra-low-cost carriers) have a profound impact on industry revenues. using the advantage of low unit costs, these carriers offer lower fares in order to shift demand from larger, more established airlines, and represent significant competitors, particularly for customers who fly infrequently and are price sensitive and tend not to be loyal to any one particular carrier. while historically these carriers have provided competition in domestic markets, we have recently experienced new competition from low-cost carriers on international routes. a number of these low-cost carriers have announced growth strategies including commitments to acquire significant numbers of new aircraft for delivery in the next few years. these low-cost carriers are attempting to continue to increase their market share through growth and, potentially, consolidation, and are expected to continue to have an impact on our revenues and overall performance. we and several other large network carriers have implemented basic economy fares designed to more effectively compete against low-cost carriers , but we cannot predict whether these initiatives will be successful or the competitive reaction of the low-cost carriers. competition is also increasing from low-cost airlines executing international long-haul expansion strategies, including, for example, icelandair, norwegian air shuttle and wow air. the actions of existing or future low-cost carriers, including those described above, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. we provide air travel internationally, directly as well as through joint business, alliance, codeshare and similar arrangements to which we are a party. while our network is comprehensive, compared to some of our key global competitors, we generally have somewhat greater relative exposure to certain regions (for example, latin america) and somewhat lower relative exposures to others (for example, china and parts of asia). our financial performance relative to our key competitors will therefore be influenced significantly by macro-economic conditions in particular regions around the world and the relative exposure of our network to the markets in those regions. in providing international air transportation, we compete to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the u.s. and various overseas locations with u.s. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines. competition is increasing from foreign state-owned and state-affiliated airlines in the gulf region, including emirates, etihad airways and qatar airways. these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft in service and on order and are increasing service to the u.s. from locations both in and outside the middle east. service to and from locations outside of the middle east is provided by some of these carriers under so-called fifth freedom rights permitted under international treaties which allow service to and from stopover points between an airline s home country and the ultimate destination. such flights, such as a stopover in europe on flights to the united states, allow the carrier to sell tickets for travel between the stopover point and the united states in competition with service provided by us. additionally, these carriers have made significant investments in a number of airlines located outside of the middle east, such as air italy, providing these affiliated airlines with capital and aircraft to permit increases in service that compete with us. we believe these state-owned and state-affiliated carriers in the gulf region, including their affiliated carriers, benefit from significant government subsidies, which have allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence. competition is also increasing from low-cost airlines executing international long-haul expansion strategies, including, for example, icelandair, norwegian air shuttle and wow air. our international service exposes us to foreign economies and the potential for reduced demand, such as we have recently experienced in venezuela, when any foreign country we serve suffers adverse local economic conditions. in addition, open skies agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world provide international airlines with open access to u.s. markets, potentially subjecting us to increased competition on our international routes. see also our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages. certain airline alliances, joint ventures and joint businesses have been, or may in the future be, granted immunity from antitrust regulations by governmental authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. to the extent alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, our ability to effectively compete may be hindered. our ability to attract and retain customers is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to offer our customers convenient access to desired markets. our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain or obtain alliance and marketing relationships with other air carriers in desired markets. american has established a transatlantic jba with british airways, iberia and finnair, and separately, a transpacific jba with japan airlines, each of which has been granted antitrust immunity. in october 2017, american and its transatlantic partners executed an amended and restated jba which, among other things, extends the term of the agreement. an application is pending with the dot to add aer lingus, which is now owned by the parent company of british airways and iberia, to the transatlantic jba. this relationship benefits from a grant of antitrust immunity from the dot and was reviewed by the ec in july 2010. in connection with this review, we provided certain commitments to the ec regarding, among other things, the availability of take-off and landing slots at lhr or lgw airports. the commitments accepted by the ec are binding for 10 years with the possibility of renewal by the ec. however, in light of brexit and the related possibility that the ec would no 17 longer have regulatory responsibility for the united kingdom when the commitments expire in july 2020, the united kingdom cma in october 2018 opened an investigation into the transatlantic jba. we are cooperating fully with the cma. also, we had previously signed a jba with qantas airways and in 2015, applied for antitrust immunity with the dot for the revised relationship, but we withdrew that application in november 2016 after it was tentatively denied by the dot. in february 2018, we filed a new application for antitrust immunity with the dot, which, if granted, would allow us to further expand our relationship with qantas airways. this jba has been approved by the competition law regulators in australia and new zealand. in addition, we have signed jbas with certain air carriers of the latam airlines group, which jbas have been approved in all jurisdictions other than the united states, where approval is pending. most recently, in november 2018, the court of free competition in chile approved the jba between american and latam airlines group with respect to both our passenger and cargo businesses. that decision has been appealed to the chilean supreme court. the foregoing arrangements are important aspects of our international network and we are dependent on the performance and continued cooperation of the other airlines party to those agreements. no assurances can be given as to any benefits that we may derive from such arrangements or any other arrangements that may ultimately be implemented, or whether or not regulators will continue to approve or impose material conditions on our business activities. additional mergers and other forms of industry consolidation, including antitrust immunity grants, may take place and may not involve us as a participant. depending on which carriers combine and which assets, if any, are sold or otherwise transferred to other carriers in connection with any such combinations, our competitive position relative to the post-combination carriers or other carriers that acquire such assets could be harmed. in addition, as carriers combine through traditional mergers or antitrust immunity grants, their route networks will grow, and that growth will result in greater overlap with our network, which in turn could result in lower overall market share and revenues for us. such consolidation is not limited to the u.s., but could include further consolidation among international carriers in europe and elsewhere. additionally, our aadvantage loyalty program, which is an important element of our sales and marketing programs, faces significant and increasing competition from the loyalty programs offered by other travel companies, as well as from similar loyalty benefits offered by banks and other financial services companies. competition among loyalty programs is intense regarding the rewards, fees, required usage, and other terms and conditions of these programs. these competitive factors affect our ability to attract and retain customers, increase usage of our loyalty program and maximize the revenue generated by our loyalty program. evolving data security and privacy requirements could increase our costs, and any significant data security incident could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, expose us to legal risks and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our business requires the secure processing and storage of sensitive information relating to our customers, employees, business partners and others. however, like any global enterprise operating in today s digital business environment, we are subject to threats to the security of our networks and data, including threats potentially involving criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored actors, corporate espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. these threats continue to increase as the frequency, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions increase around the world. we have been the target of cybersecurity attacks in the past and expect that we will continue to be in the future. furthermore, in response to these threats there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and cybersecurity in the u.s., the eu and elsewhere, particularly with respect to critical infrastructure providers, including those in the transportation sector. as a result, we must comply with a growing and fast-evolving set of legal requirements in this area, including substantive cybersecurity standards as well as requirements for notifying regulators and affected individuals in the event of a data security incident. this regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs and enforcement risks. for example, in may 2018, the eu s new general data protection regulation, commonly referred to as gdpr, came into effect, which imposes a host of new data privacy and security requirements, imposing significant costs on us and carrying substantial penalties for non-compliance. in addition, many of our commercial partners, including credit card companies, have imposed data security standards that we must meet. in particular, we are required by the payment card industry security standards council, founded by the credit card companies, to comply with their highest level of data security standards. while we continue our efforts to meet these standards, new and revised standards may be imposed that may be difficult for us to meet and could increase our costs. a significant cybersecurity incident could result in a range of potentially material negative consequences for us, including unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of company systems or data; theft of sensitive, regulated or confidential data, such as personal identifying information or our intellectual property; the loss of functionality 18 of critical systems through ransomware, denial of service or other attacks; and business delays, service or system disruptions, damage to equipment and injury to persons or property. the methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. similarly, we depend on the ability of our key commercial partners, including our regional carriers, distribution partners and technology vendors, to conduct their businesses in a manner that complies with applicable security standards and assures their ability to perform on a timely basis. in addition, the costs and operational consequences of defending against, preparing for, responding to and remediating an incident of cybersecurity breach may be substantial. as cybersecurity threats become more frequent, intense and sophisticated, costs of proactive defense measures may increase. further, we could be exposed to litigation, regulatory enforcement or other legal action as a result of an incident, carrying the potential for damages, fines, sanctions or other penalties, as well as injunctive relief requiring costly compliance measures. a cybersecurity incident could also impact our brand, harm our reputation and adversely impact our relationship with our customers, employees and stockholders. failure to appropriately address these issues could also give rise to potentially material legal risks and liabilities. our high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions. we have significant amounts of indebtedness and other obligations, including pension obligations, obligations to make future payments on flight equipment and property leases related to airport and other facilities, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. moreover, currently a substantial portion of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, which are generally greater than the indebtedness and other obligations of our competitors, could have important consequences. for example, they: may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness; may limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, integration costs, and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes; make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, industry conditions and catastrophic external events, particularly relative to competitors with lower relative levels of financial leverage; contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities; contain restrictive covenants that could, among other things: limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends; significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own operations, the u.s. or global economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines; limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions; and result in an event of default under our indebtedness. further, a substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the london interbank offered rate (libor) for deposits of u.s. dollars. libor tends to fluctuate based on general short-term interest rates, rates set by the u.s. federal reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market and general economic conditions. we have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt. accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on libor and other 19 variable interest rates. to the extent the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. on july 27, 2017, the financial conduct authority (the authority that regulates libor) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021. it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. the u.s. federal reserve, in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee, is considering replacing u.s. dollar libor with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. it is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the united kingdom, the united states or elsewhere. see also the discussion of interest rate risk in part ii, item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest. these obligations also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. we will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully. our business plan contemplates continued significant investments related to modernizing our fleet, improving the experience of our customers and updating our facilities. significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan. we estimate that, based on our commitments as of december 31, 2018 , our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for calendar years 2019 - 2023 would be approximately $8.4 billion . accordingly, we will need substantial financing or other capital resources to finance such aircraft and engines. if we are unable to arrange financing for such aircraft and engines at customary advance rates and on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase such aircraft and engines or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft and engines with the applicable aircraft and engine manufacturers. depending on numerous factors applicable at the time we seek capital, many of which are out of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets view of our prospects and the airline industry in general, and the general availability of debt and equity capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may be available only on onerous terms and conditions. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed sources of capital to operate successfully. an inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our pension funding obligations are significant. the amount of these obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. the minimum funding obligation applicable to our pension plans was subject to favorable temporary funding rules that expired at the end of 2017 and, as a result, our minimum pension funding obligations will increase materially beginning in 2019. in addition, we may have significant obligations for other postretirement benefits, retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. if our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity. we have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. these agreements allow these credit card processing companies, under certain conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, the failure of american to maintain certain levels of liquidity), to hold an amount of our cash (a holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket sales that have been processed by that credit card processor, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. these credit card processing companies are not currently entitled to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. these holdback requirements can be modified at the discretion of the credit card processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition. an increase in the current holdbacks, up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales, would materially reduce our liquidity. likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow other entities to impose less-favorable terms, including the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition. 20 union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels may adversely affect our operations and financial performance. relations between air carriers and labor unions in the u.s. are governed by the rla. under the rla, cbas generally contain amendable dates rather than expiration dates, and the rla requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the nmb. for the dates that the cbas with our major work groups become amendable under the rla, see part i, item 1. business employees and labor relations . in the case of a cba that is amendable under the rla, if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator. the rla prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. if no agreement is reached in mediation, the nmb in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration to the parties. either party may decline to submit to arbitration, and if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day cooling off period commences. during or after that period, a peb may be established, which examines the parties positions and recommends a solution. the peb process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day cooling off period. at the end of a cooling off period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by congress, the labor organization may exercise self-help, such as a strike, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. none of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully engage in concerted slowdowns or refusals to work, such as strikes, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. nonetheless, there is a risk that disgruntled employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance. additionally, some of our unions have brought and may continue to bring grievances to binding arbitration, including those related to wages. if successful, there is a risk these judicial or arbitral avenues could result in material additional costs that we did not anticipate. see also part i, item 1. business employees and labor relations. as of december 31, 2018 , approximately 84% of our employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions. currently, we believe our labor costs are competitive relative to the other large network carriers. however, we cannot provide assurance that labor costs going forward will remain competitive because we are in negotiations for some new agreements now and other agreements may become amendable, competitors may significantly reduce their labor costs or we may agree to higher-cost provisions unilaterally or in connection with our current or future labor negotiations. interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our key facilities could have a material adverse impact on our operations. we operate principally through hubs in charlotte, chicago, dallas/fort worth, los angeles, miami, new york, philadelphia, phoenix and washington, d.c. substantially all of our flights either originate at or fly into one of these locations. a significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs or other airports where we have a significant presence, such as lhr, resulting from atc delays, weather conditions, natural disasters, growth constraints, performance by third-party service providers (such as electric utility or telecommunications providers), failure of computer systems, disruptions at airport facilities or other key facilities used by us to manage our operations (such as occurred in the united kingdom at lgw on december 20, 2018 and lhr on january 8, 2019 due to unauthorized drone activity), labor relations, power supplies, fuel supplies, terrorist activities, or otherwise could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we have limited control, particularly in the short-term, over the operation, quality or maintenance of many of the services on which our operations depend and over whether vendors of such services will improve or continue to provide services that are essential to our business. if we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations. in order to operate our existing and proposed flight schedule and, where desirable, add service along new or existing routes, we must be able to maintain and/or obtain adequate gates, check-in counters, operations areas, operations control facilities and administrative support space. as airports around the world become more congested, it may not be possible for us to ensure that our plans for new service can be implemented in a commercially viable manner, given operating constraints at airports throughout our network, including those imposed by inadequate facilities at desirable airports. 21 in light of constraints on existing facilities, there is presently a significant amount of capital spending underway at major airports in the united states, including large projects underway at a number of airports where we have significant operations, such as ord, lax, lga and dca. this spending is expected to result in increased costs to airlines and the traveling public that use those facilities as the airports seek to recover their investments through increased rental, landing and other facility costs. in some circumstances, such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without our approval. accordingly, our operating costs are expected to increase significantly at many airports at which we operate, including a number of our hubs and gateways, as a result of capital spending projects currently underway and additional projects that we expect to commence over the next several years . in addition, operations at three major domestic airports, certain smaller domestic airports and many foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through the use of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms that limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period and may have other operational restrictions as well. in the u.s., the dot and the faa currently regulate the allocation of slots or slot exemptions at dca and two new york city airports: jfk and lga. our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or similar regulatory authority. in addition to slot restrictions, operations at lga and dca are also limited based on a so-called perimeter rule which generally limits the stage length of the flights that can be operated from those airports to 1,500 and 1,250 miles, respectively. similarly, our operations at lhr, international airports in beijing, frankfurt, paris, tokyo and other airports outside the u.s. are regulated by local slot authorities pursuant to the iata worldwide scheduling guidelines and/or applicable local law. termination of slot controls at some or all of the foregoing airports could affect our operational performance and competitive position. we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally, but not always, been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. however, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient slots or analogous authorizations in the future or as to the cost of acquiring such rights because, among other reasons, such allocations are often sought after by other airlines and are subject to changes in governmental policies. we cannot provide any assurance that regulatory changes regarding the allocation of slots, the continued enforcement of a perimeter rule or similar regulatory authority will not have a material adverse impact on our operations. our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as ord and lax where the airport gate and other facilities are currently inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide, or airports such as dallas love field airport where we have no access to gates at all. any limitation on our ability to acquire or maintain adequate gates, ticketing facilities, operations areas, operations control facilities, slots (where applicable), or office space could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. if we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services. a significant portion of our regional operations are conducted by third-party operators on our behalf, substantially all of which are provided for under capacity purchase agreements. due to our reliance on third parties to provide these essential services, we are subject to the risk of disruptions to their operations, which may result from many of the same risk factors disclosed in this report, such as the impact of adverse economic conditions, the inability of third parties to hire or retain skilled personnel, including pilots and mechanics, and other risk factors, such as an out-of-court or bankruptcy restructuring of any of our regional operators. many of these third-party regional operators provide significant regional capacity that we would be unable to replace in a short period of time should that operator fail to perform its obligations to us. disruptions to capital markets, shortages of skilled personnel and adverse economic conditions in general have subjected certain of these third-party regional operators to significant financial pressures, which have in the past and may in the future lead to bankruptcies among these operators. we may also experience disruption to our regional operations if we terminate the capacity purchase agreement with one or more of our current operators and transition the services to another provider. any significant disruption to our regional operations would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, our reliance upon others to provide essential services on behalf of our operations may result in our relative inability to control the efficiency and timeliness of contract services. we have entered into agreements with contractors to provide various facilities and services required for our operations, including distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, reservations, provision of information technology and services, regional operations, aircraft maintenance, ground services and facilities and baggage handling. similar agreements may be entered into in any new markets we decide to serve. these agreements are generally subject to termination after notice by the third-party service provider. we are also at risk should one 22 of these service providers cease operations, and there is no guarantee that we could replace these providers on a timely basis with comparably priced providers, or at all. any material problems with the efficiency and timeliness of contract services, resulting from financial hardships or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the commercial relationships that we have with airlines, including any related equity investment, may not produce the returns or results we expect. an important part of our strategy to expand our network has been to expand our commercial relationships with other airlines, such as by entering into global alliance, joint business and codeshare relationships, and, in one recent instance involving china southern airlines, by making a significant equity investment in another airline in connection with initiating such a commercial relationship. we may explore similar non-controlling investments in, and joint ventures and strategic alliances with, other carriers as part of our global business strategy. we face competition in forming these commercial relationships since there are a limited number of potential arrangements and other airlines are looking to enter into similar relationships. any such existing or future investment could involve significant challenges and risks, including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies. these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels. we rely on third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (gdss) (e.g., amadeus, sabre and travelport), conventional travel agents , travel management companies and online travel agents (otas) (e.g., expedia, including its booking sites orbitz and travelocity, and the priceline group), to distribute a significant portion of our airline tickets, and we expect in the future to continue to rely on these channels. we are also dependent upon the ability and willingness of these distribution channels to expand their ability to distribute and collect revenues for ancillary products (e.g., fees for selective seating). these distribution channels are more expensive and at present have less functionality in respect of ancillary product offerings than those we operate ourselves, such as our website at www.aa.com . certain of these distribution channels also effectively restrict the manner in which we distribute our products generally. to remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of our distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. further, as distribution technology changes we will need to continue to update our technology by acquiring new technology from third parties, building the functionality ourselves, or a combination, which in any event will likely entail significant technological and commercial risk and involve potentially material investments. these imperatives may affect our relationships with conventional travel agents , travel management companies, gdss and otas, including if consolidation of conventional travel agents, travel management companies, gdss or otas continues, or should any of these parties seek to acquire other technology providers thereby potentially limiting our technology alternatives, such as the proposed acquisition of farelogix by sabre. any inability to manage our third-party distribution costs, rights and functionality at a competitive level or any material diminishment or disruption in the distribution of our tickets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages. airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. in the last several years, congress has passed laws, and the dot, the faa, the tsa and the dhs have issued a number of directives and other regulations, that affect the airline industry. these requirements impose substantial costs on us and restrict the ways we may conduct our business. for example, the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures or operational restrictions. these requirements can be issued with little or no notice, or can otherwise impact our ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft, and in some instances have resulted in the temporary grounding of aircraft types altogether, or otherwise caused substantial disruption and resulted in material costs to us and lost revenues. the faa also exercises comprehensive regulatory authority over nearly all technical aspects of our operations. our failure to comply with such requirements has in the past and may in the future result in fines and other enforcement actions by the faa or other regulators. in the future, any new regulatory requirements, particularly requirements that limit our ability to operate or price our products, could have a material adverse effect on us and the industry. 23 dot consumer rules dictate procedures for customer handling during long onboard delays, further regulate airline interactions with passengers, including passengers with disabilities, through the ticketing process, at the airport, and onboard the aircraft, and require disclosures concerning airline fares and ancillary fees such as baggage fees. other dot rules apply to post-ticket purchase price increases and an expansion of tarmac delay regulations to international airlines. the aviation and transportation security act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per-ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. present and potential future security requirements can have the effect of imposing costs and inconvenience on travelers, potentially reducing the demand for air travel. the results of our operations, demand for air travel, and the manner in which we conduct business each may be affected by changes in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies, including: changes in law that affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particular markets and at particular airports, or the types of fares offered or fees that can be charged to passengers; the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including antitrust or foreign government approvals) needed for codesharing alliances, joint businesses and other arrangements with other airlines; restrictions on competitive practices (for example, court orders, or agency regulations or orders, that would curtail an airline s ability to respond to a competitor); the adoption of new passenger security standards or regulations that impact customer service standards; restrictions on airport operations, such as restrictions on the use of slots at airports or the auction or reallocation of slot rights currently held by us; and the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions. each additional regulation or other form of regulatory oversight increases costs and adds greater complexity to airline operations and, in some cases, may reduce the demand for air travel. there can be no assurance that our compliance with new rules, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight will not have a material adverse effect on us. any significant reduction in air traffic capacity at and in the airspace serving key airports in the u.s. or overseas could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, the united states national airspace system (the atc system) is not successfully modernizing to meet the growing demand for u.s. air travel. air traffic controllers rely on outdated procedures and technologies that routinely compel airlines to fly inefficient routes or take significant delays on the ground. the atc system s inability to manage existing travel demand has led government agencies to implement short-term capacity constraints during peak travel periods or adverse weather conditions in certain markets, resulting in delays and disruptions of air traffic. the outdated technologies also cause the atc system to be less resilient in the event of a failure. for example, an automation failure and an evacuation, in 2015 and 2017, respectively, at the washington air route control center resulted in cancellations and delays of hundreds of flights traversing the greater washington, d.c. airspace. in the early 2000s, the faa embarked on a path to modernize the national airspace system, including migration from the current radar-based atc system to a gps-based system. this modernization of the atc system, generally referred to as nextgen, has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and it remains uncertain when the full array of benefits expected from this modernization will be available to the public and the airlines. failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial costs that may be imposed on airlines in order to fund a modernized atc system may have a material adverse effect on our business. further, our business has been adversely impacted when government agencies have ceased to operate as expected including due to partial shut-downs, sequestrations or similar events. these events have resulted in, among other things, reduced demand for air travel, an actual or perceived reduction in atc and security screening resources and related travel delays, as well as disruption in the ability of the faa to grant required regulatory approvals, such as are involved when a new aircraft is first placed into service. our operating authority in international markets is subject to aviation agreements between the u.s. and the respective countries or governmental authorities, such as the eu, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the dot and/or the relevant foreign governments. moreover, alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. the u.s. government has negotiated open skies agreements with many 24 countries, which allow unrestricted route authority access between the u.s. and the foreign markets. while the u.s. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of markets important to us, including china, do not have open skies agreements. for example, the open skies air services agreement between the u.s. and the eu, which took effect in march 2008, provides airlines from the u.s. and eu member states open access to each other s markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly from the u.s. to any airport in the eu, including lhr. as a result of the agreement and a subsequent open skies agreement involving the u.s. and the united kingdom, which was agreed in anticipation of brexit, we face increased competition in these markets, including lhr. bilateral and multilateral agreements among the u.s. and various foreign governments of countries we serve but which are not covered by an open skies treaty are subject to periodic renegotiation. we currently operate a number of international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of airlines permitted to operate on the route, the capacity of the airlines providing services on the route, or the number of airlines allowed access to particular airports. if an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these markets, it could have a material adverse impact on us and could result in the impairment of material amounts of our related tangible and intangible assets. in addition, competition from foreign airlines, revenue-sharing joint ventures, jbas, and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of our business and assets on the open skies routes. the pending withdrawal of the united kingdom from the eu, commonly referred to as brexit, is currently scheduled to occur on march 29, 2019 and will mandate further modification in the current regulatory regime. we face risks associated with the united kingdom s exit from the eu, notably given the extent of our passenger and cargo traffic and that of our joint business partners that flows through lhr in the united kingdom. absent an approved withdrawal agreement between the united kingdom and the eu (resulting in the so-called no deal brexit scenario), our expectation is that air services (including those involving our joint business and code share partners) will continue substantially as we currently conduct them, at least for a transition period, in reliance on reciprocal basic connectivity traffic rights proposed by the eu and the united kingdom and a new air services agreement between the u.s. and united kingdom concluded on november 29, 2018. however, the precise scope of traffic rights between the eu and the united kingdom remains uncertain and therefore the continuation of our current services is not assured and could be subject to disruption. if brexit is accomplished pursuant to a withdrawal agreement consistent with the agreement presently being discussed between the united kingdom and the eu, but which has yet to be approved by the united kingdom, our current air services would continue as we currently conduct them during a transition period running through the end of 2020, with a potential extension of up to two years. during that transition period, the united kingdom and the eu would seek to implement a new air services agreement. we cannot predict the terms of any such successor air services agreement or whether changes in the relationship between the united kingdom and the eu, including whether or not the united kingdom withdraws from the eu with or without an agreement, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. more generally, changes in u.s. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of route authorities, slots or other assets located abroad, or otherwise adversely affect our international operations. the airline industry is heavily taxed. the airline industry is subject to extensive government fees and taxation that negatively impact our revenue and profitability. the u.s. airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed of all industries. these fees and taxes have grown significantly in the past decade for domestic flights, and various u.s. fees and taxes also are assessed on international flights. for example, as permitted by federal legislation, most major u.s. airports impose a passenger facility charge per passenger on us. in addition, the governments of foreign countries in which we operate impose on u.s. airlines, including us, various fees and taxes, and these assessments have been increasing in number and amount in recent years. moreover, we are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the ticket tax, on domestic and international air transportation. we collect the excise tax, along with certain other u.s. and foreign taxes and user fees on air transportation (such as passenger security fees), and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies. although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. there are continuing efforts in congress and in other countries to raise different portions of the various taxes, fees, and charges imposed on airlines and their passengers, including the passenger facility charge, and we may not be able to recover all of these charges from our customers. increases in such taxes, fees and charges could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. under dot regulations, all governmental taxes and fees must be included in the prices we quote or advertise to our customers. due to the competitive revenue environment, many increases in these fees and taxes have been absorbed by the airline industry rather than being passed on to the customer. further increases in fees and taxes may reduce demand for air travel, and thus our revenues. 25 recent u.s. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. recently enacted u.s. tax legislation has significantly changed the u.s. federal income taxation of u.s. corporations, including by reducing the u.s. corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, permitting immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, revising the rules governing net operating losses (nols) and the rules governing foreign tax credits and introducing new anti-base erosion provisions. many of these changes became effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementation regulations by the treasury and internal revenue service, any of which could materially affect the impacts of the legislation. in addition, it is unclear how these u.s. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. see note 7 to aag s consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8a and note 5 to american s consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8b for additional information on income taxes. changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be successful and may cause operational difficulties or decreased demand. we have recently instituted, and intend to institute in the future, changes to our business model designed to increase revenues and offset costs. these measures include further segmentation of the classes of services we offer, such as premium economy service and basic economy service, enhancements to our aadvantage loyalty program, charging separately for services that had previously been included within the price of a ticket, increasing other pre-existing fees, reconfiguration of our aircraft cabins, and efforts to optimize our network including by focusing growth on a limited number of large hubs. we may introduce additional initiatives in the future; however, as time goes on, we expect that it will be more difficult to identify and implement additional initiatives. we cannot assure you that these measures or any future initiatives will be successful in increasing our revenues. additionally, the implementation of these initiatives may create logistical challenges that could harm the operational performance of our airline or result in decreased demand. also, our implementation of any new or increased fees might reduce the demand for air travel on our airline or across the industry in general, particularly if weakened economic conditions make our customers more sensitive to increased travel costs or provide a significant competitive advantage to other carriers that determine not to institute similar charges. the loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business. we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain or attract highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. we may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified personnel. any inability to retain or attract significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks; the travel industry continues to face ongoing security concerns. acts of terrorism or fear of such attacks, including elevated national threat warnings, wars or other military conflicts, may depress air travel, particularly on international routes, and cause declines in revenues and increases in costs. the attacks of september 11, 2001 and continuing terrorist threats, attacks and attempted attacks materially impacted and continue to impact air travel. increased security procedures introduced at airports since the attacks of september 11, 2001 and any other such measures that may be introduced in the future generate higher operating costs for airlines. the aviation and transportation security act mandated improved flight deck security, deployment of federal air marshals on board flights, improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security training, enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, additional provision of passenger data to the u.s. customs and border protection agency and enhanced background checks. a concurrent increase in airport security charges and procedures, such as restrictions on carry-on baggage, has also had and may continue to have a disproportionate impact on short-haul travel, which constitutes a significant portion of our flying and revenue. implementation of and compliance with increasingly-complex security and customs requirements will continue to result in increased costs for us and our passengers, and have caused and likely will continue to cause periodic service disruptions and delays. we have at times found it necessary or desirable to make significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while seeking to reduce their impact on our customers, such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. as a result of competitive pressure, and the need to improve security screening throughput 26 to support the pace of our operations, it is unlikely that we will be able to capture all security-related costs through increased fares. in addition, we cannot forecast what new security requirements may be imposed in the future, or their impact on our business. we operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control. we operate a global business with significant operations outside of the u.s. our current international activities and prospects have been and in the future could be adversely affected by government policies, reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, increased competition in international markets, the performance of our alliance, joint business and codeshare partners in a given market, exchange controls or other restrictions on repatriation of funds, currency and political risks (including changes in exchange rates and currency devaluations), environmental regulation, increases in taxes and fees and changes in international government regulation of our operations, including the inability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or slots. fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, exchange controls and other restrictions on the repatriation of funds, have significantly affected and may continue to significantly affect our operating performance, liquidity and the value of any cash held outside the u.s. in local currency. such fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by us and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the united states. these conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. more generally, much of the demand for international air travel is the result of business travel in support of global trade. should protectionist governmental policies, such as increased tariff barriers, travel limitation and other actions, have the effect of reducing global commercial activity, the result could be a material decrease in the demand for international air travel. the united kingdom held a referendum in june 2016 regarding its membership in the eu in which a majority of the united kingdom electorate voted in favor of the british government taking the necessary action for the united kingdom to leave the eu, an event commonly referred to as brexit. in march 2017, the united kingdom served notice of its decision to withdraw from the eu, formally initiating the withdrawal process. serving this notice began the two-year period for the united kingdom to negotiate the terms for its withdrawal from the eu , currently scheduled to occur on march 29, 2019. we face risks associated with the uncertainty following the referendum and the consequences that may flow from the decision to exit the eu, notably given the extent of our passenger and cargo traffic and that of our joint business partners that flows through lhr in the united kingdom. absent an approved withdrawal agreement between the united kingdom and the eu (resulting in the so-called no deal brexit scenario), our expectation is that air services (including those involving our joint business and code share partners) will continue substantially as we currently conduct them, at least for a transition period, in reliance on reciprocal basic connectivity traffic rights proposed by the eu and the united kingdom and the new air services agreements between the u.s. and united kingdom concluded on november 29, 2018. however, the precise scope of traffic rights between the eu and the united kingdom remains uncertain and therefore the continuation is not assured and could be subject to disruption. if brexit is accomplished pursuant to a withdrawal agreement consistent with the agreement presently being discussed between the united kingdom and the eu, but which has yet to be approved by the united kingdom, our current air services would continue as we currently conduct them during a transition period running through the end of 2020, with a potential extension of up to two years. during that transition period, the united kingdom and the eu would seek to implement a new air services agreement. we cannot predict the terms of any such successor air services agreement or whether changes in the relationship between the united kingdom and the eu, including whether or not the united kingdom withdraws from the eu with or without an agreement, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. moreover, the exit of the united kingdom from the eu could adversely affect european or worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to further instability in global financial markets. in addition, the exit of the united kingdom from the eu has created uncertainty as to the future trade relationship between the eu and the united kingdom, including air traffic services. lhr is presently a very important element of our international network, however it may become less desirable as a destination or as a hub location after brexit when compared to other airports in europe. the exit of the united kingdom from the eu could also lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty such as the identity of the relevant regulators, new regulatory action and/or potentially divergent treaties, laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which eu treaties, laws and regulations to replace or replicate, including those governing aviation, labor, environmental, data protection/privacy, competition and other matters applicable to the provision of air transportation services by us or our alliance, joint business or codeshare partners. for example, in light of brexit and the related possibility that the ec would no longer have regulatory responsibility for the united kingdom when existing regulatory commitments are scheduled to expire in 2020, the united kingdom cma in october 2018 opened an investigation into our transatlantic jba. we are cooperating fully with the cma. the impact on our business of any treaties, laws and regulations that replace the existing eu counterparts, or other 27 governmental or regulatory actions taken by the united kingdom or the eu in connection with or subsequent to brexit, cannot be predicted, including whether or not regulators will continue to approve or impose material conditions on our business activities. any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. we are subject to many forms of environmental and noise regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result. we are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment and noise reduction, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the management of hazardous substances, oils and waste materials. compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties. we are also subject to other environmental laws and regulations, including those that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. under federal law, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of waste directly attributable to us. we have liability for investigation and remediation costs at various sites, although such costs currently are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. we have various leases and agreements with respect to real property, tanks and pipelines with airports and other operators. under these leases and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the lessor or operator against environmental liabilities associated with the real property or operations described under the agreement, in some cases even if we are not the party responsible for the initial event that caused the environmental damage. we also participate in leases with other airlines in fuel consortiums and fuel committees at airports, where such indemnities are generally joint and several among the participating airlines. governmental authorities in several u.s. and foreign cities are also considering, or have already implemented, aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews and limitations on daytime take offs and landings. we have been able to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, but our operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread. our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights, are valuable, and any inability to protect them may adversely affect our business and financial results. we consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights such as our trademarks applicable to our airline and aadvantage loyalty program, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. we protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, copyright and other forms of legal protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results. any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, either of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. we are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. there is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and ghg emissions. efforts by the eu in 2009 to regulate flights arriving from or departing for airports outside of the eu have been postponed as members of icao are negotiating a global agreement on ghg emissions from the aviation sector. in 2016, icao passed a resolution adopting corsia, which is a global, market-based emissions offset program intended to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. corsia was supported by the board of airlines for america (the principal u.s. airline trade association) and iata (the principal international airline trade association), and by american and many other u.s. and foreign airlines. in march 2017, icao also adopted new aircraft certification standards to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft, which will apply to new aircraft type designs in 2020, and to aircraft type designs already in production as of 2023. on june 27, 2018, icao adopted standards pertaining to the collection and sharing of information on international aviation emissions beginning in 2019. airline operators must prepare ghg monitoring plans by february 2019. corsia will increase operating costs for american and most other airlines, including other u.s. airlines that operate internationally, but the implementation of a global program, as compared to regional emission reduction schemes, should ensure that these costs will be more evenly applied to american and its 28 competitors since there will be a common global regulatory regime. corsia is expected to be implemented in phases, with information collection and sharing beginning in 2019, a pilot phase beginning in 2021, and the first phase beginning in 2024. certain details still need to be developed and the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted. while we do not anticipate any significant emissions allowance expenditures in 2019, compliance with corsia or similar emissions-related requirements could significantly increase our operating costs beginning in 2021 and beyond. separately, the eu has established the ets to regulate ghg emissions in the eu. the eu adopted a directive in 2008 under which each eu member state is required to extend the ets to aviation operations. however, the eu ets has never fully been imposed, in large part due to the effort to adopt corsia. the eu has extended its stay on the extra-territorial application of the eu ets as applied to international flights to/from the eea through year-end 2023, contingent on successful implementation of corsia. thereafter, the eu will assess corsia implementation and decide the future status of the eu ets as applied to international aviation to/from the eea. the potential impact of corsia or other emissions-related requirements on our costs will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including baseline emissions, the price of emission allowances or offsets that american would need to acquire , the ghg efficiency of the american fleet, and the number of future american flights subject to such emissions-related requirements. these costs have not been completely defined and could fluctuate. in 2019, the epa could finalize a rule implementing aircraft engine ghg emission standards developed initially through icao. it is anticipated that the epa rule will closely align with recent icao carbon dioxide emission standards. the new standards, which were supported by the airline industry and manufacturers, would apply to new type aircraft certified beginning in 2020, and would be phased in for newly manufactured existing aircraft type designs starting in 2023. in addition, several states have adopted or are considering initiatives to regulate ghg emissions, primarily through the planned development of ghg emissions inventories, regional ghg cap and trade programs or low carbon fuels programs. depending on the scope of such regulation, certain of our facilities and operations, or the operations of our suppliers, may be subject to additional operating and other permit requirements, likely resulting in increased operating costs. in addition, in december 2015, at the 21st conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, over 190 countries, including the united states, reached an agreement (the paris agreement) to reduce ghg emissions. while the united states has since announced that it will withdraw from the paris agreement and there is no express reference to aviation in the paris agreement, to the extent countries implement the paris agreement or impose other climate change regulations, either with respect to the aviation industry or with respect to related industries such as the aviation fuel industry, it could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business. these regulatory efforts, both internationally and in the u.s. at the federal and state levels, are still developing, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in the u.s., the eu or in other areas in which we do business. however, such climate change-related regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions. such activity may also impact us indirectly by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs. any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results. maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to our business. our reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by any failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental sustainability practices for all of our operations and activities, our impact on the environment, public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies, such as movements to institute a living wage, customer perceptions of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs, customer perceptions of our use of social media, or customer perceptions of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents or other third parties. damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of customer confidence in our services could adversely affect our business and financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. 29 we face challenges in integrating our computer, communications and other technology systems. among the principal risks of integrating our businesses and operations are the risks relating to integrating various computer, communications and other technology systems that are necessary to operate us airways and american as a single integrated business and to achieve cost synergies by eliminating redundancies. while we have to date successfully integrated many of our systems, including our customer reservations system and our pilot, flight attendant and fleet scheduling system, we still have to complete several additional important system integration or replacement projects. in a number of prior airline mergers, the integration of these systems or deployment of replacement systems has taken longer, been more disruptive and cost more than originally forecasted. the implementation process to integrate or replace these various systems will involve a number of risks that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. new systems will replace multiple legacy systems and the related implementation will be a complex and time-consuming project involving substantial expenditures for implementation consultants, system hardware, software and implementation activities, as well as the transformation of business and financial processes. we cannot assure you that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans will be adequate to prevent disruptions or delays in connection with systems integration or replacement. disruptions in or changes to these systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these technologies or systems could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. we are highly dependent on existing and emerging technology and automated systems to operate our business. these technologies and systems include our computerized airline reservation system, flight operations systems, financial planning, management and accounting systems, telecommunications systems, website, maintenance systems and check-in kiosks. in order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information and deliver flight information, as well as issue electronic tickets and process critical financial information in a timely manner. substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets. we depend on our reservation system, which is hosted and maintained under a long-term contract by a third-party service provider, to be able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets. if our technologies or automated systems are not functioning or if our third-party service providers were to fail to adequately provide technical support, system maintenance or timely software upgrades for any one of our key existing systems, we could experience service disruptions or delays, which could harm our business and result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses and decrease our revenues. in the event that one or more of our primary technology or systems vendors goes into bankruptcy, ceases operations or fails to perform as promised, replacement services may not be readily available on a timely basis, at competitive rates or at all, and any transition time to a new system may be significant. our technologies and automated systems cannot be completely protected against events that are beyond our control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, data theft, equipment and software failures, computer viruses or telecommunications failures. substantial or sustained system failures could cause service delays or failures and result in our customers purchasing tickets from other airlines. we cannot assure you that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans are adequate to prevent disruptions or delays. disruption in or changes to these technologies or systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any public incident involving our company, our people or our brand, including any accident or other public incident involving our personnel or aircraft, or the personnel or aircraft of our regional, codeshare or joint business operators. in a modern world where news can be captured and travel rapidly, we are at risk of adverse publicity stemming from any public incident involving our company, our people or our brand. such an incident could involve the actual or alleged behavior of any of our more than 125,000 employees. further, if our personnel or one of our aircraft, or personnel of, or an aircraft that is operated under our brand by, one of our regional operators or an airline with which we have a marketing alliance, joint business or codeshare relationship, were to be involved in a public incident, accident or catastrophe, we could be exposed to significant reputational harm and potential legal liability. the insurance we carry may be inapplicable or inadequate to cover any such incident, accident or catastrophe. in the event that our insurance is inapplicable or not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an incident or accident. in addition, any such incident, accident or catastrophe involving our personnel or one of our aircraft (or personnel and aircraft of our regional operators and our codeshare partners) could create an adverse public perception, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our 30 aircraft or those of our regional operators or codeshare partners, and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of anticipated fleet capacity, and failure of new aircraft to perform as expected, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. the success of our business depends on, among other things, effectively managing the number and types of aircraft we operate. if for any reason we are unable to accept or secure deliveries of new aircraft on contractually scheduled delivery dates, this could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. our failure to integrate newly purchased aircraft into our fleet as planned might require us to seek extensions of the terms for some leased aircraft or otherwise delay the exit of certain aircraft from our fleet. such unanticipated extensions or delays may require us to operate existing aircraft beyond the point at which it is economically optimal to retire them, resulting in increased maintenance costs. if new aircraft orders are not filled on a timely basis, we could face higher operating costs than planned. in addition, if the aircraft we receive do not meet expected performance or quality standards, including with respect to fuel efficiency and reliability, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. we depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts. we depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and many aircraft and engine parts. for example, under our current fleet plan, by 2020 all of our mainline aircraft will have been manufactured by either airbus or boeing and all of our regional aircraft will have been manufactured by either bombardier or embraer. further, our supplier base continues to consolidate as evidenced by the recent acquisition of rockwell collins by united technologies, the recently completed transaction involving airbus and bombardier and the pending transaction involving boeing and embraer. due to the limited number of these suppliers, we are vulnerable to any problems associated with the performance of their obligation to supply key aircraft, parts and engines, including design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by suppliers, adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance of any of our aircraft or any action by the faa or any other regulatory authority resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft, even temporarily. our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality. our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others: actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation, higher interest rates, wars, terrorist attacks and political instability; changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns and demographic trends; changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations, and other factors; actual or potential disruptions to the atc systems; increases in costs of safety, security, and environmental measures; outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; and weather and natural disasters, including increases in such disasters and related costs caused by more severe weather due to climate change. in particular, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as the ebola virus, middle east respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, h1n1 influenza virus, avian flu, zika virus or any other similar illness, if it were to become associated with air travel or persist for an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers travel behavior. as a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. in addition, due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year. 31 a higher than normal number of pilot retirements, more stringent duty time regulations, increased flight hour requirement for commercial airline pilots, reductions in the number of military pilots entering the commercial workforce and other factors have caused a shortage of pilots that could materially adversely affect our business. we currently have a higher than normal number of pilots eligible for retirement. large numbers of pilots in the industry are approaching the faa s mandatory retirement age of 65. our pilots and other employees are subject to rigorous certification standards, and our pilots and other crew members must adhere to flight time and rest requirements. commencing in 2013, the minimum flight hour requirement to achieve a commercial pilot s license in the united states (an air transport pilot s certificate) increased from 250 to 1,500 hours, thereby significantly increasing the time and cost commitment required to become licensed to fly commercial aircraft. additionally, the number of military pilots being trained by the u.s. armed forces and available as commercial pilots upon their retirement from military service has been decreasing. these and other factors have contributed to a shortage of qualified, entry-level pilots and increased compensation costs, particularly for our regional subsidiaries and our other regional partners who are being required by market conditions to pay significantly increased wages and large signing bonuses to their pilots in an attempt to achieve desired staffing levels. the foregoing factors have also led to increased competition from large, mainline carriers attempting to meet their hiring needs. we believe that this industry-wide pilot shortage is becoming an increasing problem for airlines in the united states. our regional partners have recently been unable to hire adequate numbers of pilots to meet their needs, resulting in a reduction in the number of flights offered, disruptions, increased costs of operations, financial difficulties and other adverse effects, and these circumstances may become more severe in the future and thereby cause a material adverse effect on our business. increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact our operations and financial results. the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001 led to a significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers. accordingly, our insurance costs increased significantly, and our ability to continue to obtain insurance even at current prices remains uncertain. if we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage, our business could be materially and adversely affected. additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the claims paying ability of some insurers. future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost. because of competitive pressures in our industry, our ability to pass along additional insurance costs to passengers is limited. as a result, further increases in insurance costs or reductions in available insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial results. we may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity. from time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims and government inspections or investigations and other legal matters, both inside and outside the united states, arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise. we are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future. legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control. litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. although we will vigorously defend ourselves in such legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain. for these and other reasons, we may choose to settle legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their actual merit. if a legal proceeding is resolved against us, it could result in significant compensatory damages, and in certain circumstances punitive or trebled damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief imposed on us. if our existing insurance does not cover the amount or types of damages awarded, or if other resolution or actions taken as a result of the legal proceeding were to restrain our ability to operate or market our services, our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. in addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business. additional information regarding certain legal matters in which we are involved can be found in part i, item 3. legal proceedings. 32 our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards may be limited. under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for nols carried over from prior taxable years (nol carryforwards). as of december 31, 2018 , we had available nol carryforwards of approximately $10.2 billion for regular federal income tax purposes that will expire, if unused, beginning in 2022, and approximately $3.2 billion for state income tax purposes that will expire, if unused, between 2019 and 2038. our nol carryforwards are subject to adjustment on audit by the internal revenue service and the respective state taxing authorities. a corporation s ability to deduct its federal nol carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of section 382 of the code (section 382) if it undergoes an ownership change as defined in section 382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material stockholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period). we experienced an ownership change in connection with our emergence from the chapter 11 cases and us airways group experienced an ownership change in connection with the merger. the general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. we elected to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that permitted approximately $9.0 billion (with $8.4 billion of unlimited nol still remaining at december 31, 2018 ) of our federal nol carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by section 382. if the special rules are determined not to apply, our ability to utilize such federal nol carryforwards may be subject to limitation. substantially all of our remaining federal nol carryforwards attributable to us airways group and its subsidiaries are subject to limitation under section 382 as a result of the merger; however, our ability to utilize such nol carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. notwithstanding the foregoing, an ownership change subsequent to our emergence from the chapter 11 cases may severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards and other tax attributes. to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards, our certificate of incorporation contains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial stockholders. these restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of aag common stock to dispose of or acquire shares of aag common stock. although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an ownership change from occurring, no assurance can be given that an ownership change will not occur even with these restrictions in place. our ability to use our nol carryforwards also will depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. the nol carryforwards may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use them. we have a significant amount of goodwill, which is assessed for impairment at least annually. in addition, we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing us to record material impairment charges. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are assessed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. in accordance with applicable accounting standards, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. in addition, we are required to assess certain of our other long-lived assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. future impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets could be recorded in results of operations as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates, or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that a material impairment charge of goodwill or tangible or intangible assets will be avoided. the value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by us or other airlines. an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the price of aag common stock has recently been and may in the future be volatile. the market price of aag common stock has fluctuated in the past, and may fluctuate substantially in the future, due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: macro-economic conditions, including the price of fuel; changes in market values of airline companies as well as general market conditions; our operating and financial results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors; 33 changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; changes in our level of outstanding indebtedness and other obligations; changes in our credit rating; material announcements by us or our competitors; expectations regarding our capital deployment program, including any existing or potential future share repurchase programs and any future dividend payments that may be declared by our board of directors, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends; new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines; general and industry-specific economic conditions; changes in our key personnel; distributions of shares of aag common stock pursuant to the plan, including distributions from the disputed claims reserve established under the plan; public sales of a substantial number of shares of aag common stock or issuances of aag common stock upon the exercise or conversion of restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, or other securities that may be issued from time to time; increases or decreases in reported holdings by insiders or other significant stockholders; and fluctuations in trading volume. we cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock or that our capital deployment program will enhance long-term stockholder value. our capital deployment program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves. since july 2014, as part of our capital deployment program, our board of directors has approved seven share repurchase programs aggregating $13.0 billion of authority. as of december 31, 2018 , there was $1.7 billion remaining authority to repurchase shares under our share repurchase programs. share repurchases under our repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. these share repurchase programs do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. the timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. our repurchase of aag common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. our board of directors commenced declaring quarterly cash dividends in july 2014 as part of our capital deployment program. however, any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. we are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. we will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate on a quarterly basis the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements and general business conditions. the amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will pay dividends in the future. in addition, any future repurchases of aag common stock or payment of dividends, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends, could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. the existence of a share repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. additionally, any future repurchases of aag common stock or payment of dividends will diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. further, our repurchase of aag common stock may fluctuate such that our cash flow may be insufficient to fully cover our share repurchases. although our share repurchase programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program s effectiveness. 34 certain provisions of aag s certificate of incorporation and bylaws make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of our stockholders might consider beneficial. certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. these provisions include, among other things, the following: advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholders meetings; the ability of our board of directors to fill vacancies on the board; a prohibition against stockholders taking action by written consent; stockholders are restricted from calling a special meeting unless they hold at least 20% of our outstanding shares and follow the procedures provided for in the amended bylaws; a requirement that holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors approve any amendment of our bylaws submitted to stockholders for approval; and super-majority voting requirements to modify or amend specified provisions of our certificate of incorporation. these provisions are not intended to prevent a takeover, but are intended to protect and maximize the value of the interests of our stockholders. while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors, they could enable our board of directors to prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. in addition, we are subject to the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which prohibits business combinations with interested stockholders. interested stockholders do not include stockholders whose acquisition of our securities is approved by the board of directors prior to the investment under section 203. aag s certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that limit voting and acquisition and disposition of our equity interests. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that limit voting and ownership and disposition of our equity interests, as described in part ii, item 5. market for american airlines group s common stock, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities - ownership restrictions. these restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of aag common stock and our other equity interests to vote such interests and adversely affect the ability of persons to acquire shares of aag common stock and our other equity interests.
